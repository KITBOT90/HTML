    <h3>Welcome to the ASF Network</h3>
    <p>"Harnessing the power of data and technology to advocate for sustainable paper consumption in the academic setting—one school and one student at a time."</p>
    <p>A Sustainable Future was founded on the basis of protecting our planet—starting with our schools. Every student deserves the opportunity to make lasting environmental contributions in academia. Here at A Sustainable Future, we provide students with the resources to educate themselves and others on the importance of sustainable consumption.</p>
